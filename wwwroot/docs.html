                        <p>I started up by creating a API that was supposed to have alot more than just characters in video games. 
                            After alot of pain and struggle i had to make a change where i wanted <i>games</i> to be apart of the api aswell.
                            I had to make alot of changes to the code and the database.
                            When i started of i had the idea that i wanted to use <i>Character</i> and <i>Games</i> as a starting point.
                            I quickly realised after i started that i needed to drop the <i>Games</i> database and only focus on the <i>Character</i> database.

                        <p>When i first started of i had both <i>Characters</i> and <i>Games</i>. The first thing i started doing was create the API and React app.
                            when they were both up and going i installed all the right packages. When the packages were installed i started to create some base folders for the project.
                            The first actual file i created was how the information on the <i>Characters</i> were going to look like. The ICharacter interface was the first one.
                             After i had the Databases up and running i made the controllers that you can find in the Controller folder in the API directory
                        I then went to the react folder and started to see how i would be able to gain access to the API database and what it has inside.

                        <p>The setup for the <i>Characters</i> that you will implement needs to have the setup that you see below.
                        You cannot add a string for image unfortunately that will be implemented later on in the API.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        ID: has a auto increment so you dont need to worry about that.
                        <br>
                        Name: is a string and can be null if you dont have a name for the character. 
                        However if you dont input Name you will neither be able to have an image to the character.
                        <br>
                        Game: is a string and can be null if you dont have a game for the character.

                            You have a few ways to use the API HTTP calls. <br> 
                            The existing ones are ways to gather the information from the database. <br>
                            Add information to the database. <br>
                            Delete information from the database. <br>
                            Alter some of the information in the database. <br>
                            Collect information from the database based on the ID. <br>
                            Insert information to the database while adding a image with the character. <br>
                            You can also get information about a character by the name
